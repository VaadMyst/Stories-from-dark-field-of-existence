# Poverty



Poverty sighed sweetly and chuckled slyly,
peeking through a tear in the clothes
at the suffering of her host —
a man who was poor (thanks to her),
buried in debt, still paying alimony
for a child he neither loved nor wanted.

There was never enough money for anything.
Always some problem.
And every time he took money from someone’s hands,
it slipped away, vanished.

“As if I’m cursed,” he thought.

He sighed heavily with despair and bitterness
at the unfairness of life —
where some get everything
and others can’t even feed their families
on a beggar’s wage, working like beasts.

But that troubled no one.
Those were his problems.
The system didn’t care.
Nor did Poverty,
who always found a new excuse
to bring her host more worries,
pushing him deeper and deeper
into the pit of hopelessness.

When he begged for a loan, burning with shame —
for Poverty, it was sweet music.
When he tried to break free,
found a side job or a shady trick,
Poverty ruined everything at the last moment,
moaning with delight,
listening to his desperate cries
and the weary resignation in his voice.

Every time he wanted to scream,
hoping someone might hear his pain,
he fell silent —
because everyone who looked into his eyes
saw not a man,
but a loser.
An empty shell,
with no dream, no way out.

And so, time after time,
she gently nudged him toward the irreversible act —
to end this beggarly, pointless existence.
She’d grown bored of this worker anyway.
His whining and whimpering
had long become routine in his miserable life,
and she was eager to finish him off.

She loved gamblers the most —
so suggestible, so… mmm, tender, delicious, defenceless —
with that yawning, slurping black hole in their chests
that nothing could ever fill.

She had people of every class and station —
beautiful women
who traded diamonds for heroin needles;
well‑groomed gentlemen
rotting from syphilis and dying in the gutter;
bankrupt businessmen,
curled up from overdoses;
teenagers and old men —
they all were her acquaintances,
and to each of them she whispered,
softly kissing their ears with despair…

Before this loser,
she had lived with a young single mother
whose child had been taken away
and whose parental rights were stripped.
Poverty persuaded her
to drink drain cleaner,
and the guilt whispered from outside
dissolved with the toxic slime in her stomach.
That poor woman, howling in agony,
convulsed on the cold tiled floor,
foam at her mouth.
When it was over,
a tiny gold ring slipped from her thin finger
and clinked softly against the floor.

Each night he dreamt of strangers —
and in every dream, they ended their own lives.
He watched, transfixed, as they died,
as if he were there,
leaning over them,
staring into nameless faces twisted by pain —
faces where life slowly faded
to the faint chime of a coin… or a ring.

She grinned with delight
when he caught the thought she’d planted —
about soap and a rope.

“Enough shame, enough cowardice.
Do something worthwhile
in your fucked‑up life,”
she whispered,
as he sank into sleep —
sleep that left his body aching,
his strength barely enough
to move his feet.

On a dark, rainy night,
leaving the door of his empty, dusty rented room open,
he climbed onto a chair
and tied a rope to the hook
where the chandelier once hung.

One — two — three.
Kicking the chair away,
he jerked and twisted like a puppet,
wheezing, rasping,
eyes bulging, tongue hanging out.
His face turned blue, then still.
The stench of emptied bowels
filled the room,
and Poverty inhaled it with pleasure.

When the body stopped twitching,
and the last breath left him,
Poverty slipped out, ringing —
a shiny coin
from a torn pocket.
