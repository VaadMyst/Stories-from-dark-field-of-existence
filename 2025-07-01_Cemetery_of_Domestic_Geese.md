# Cemetery of Domestic Geese


The locals called this place “Cemetery of Domestic Geese” after one mistress lost her whole goose flock in a single night.
They all died in the barn, and she buried them right there.

That cemetery stood on the edge of the village.
Locals dumped and buried dead animals there for years.
Why there? Nobody really remembered anymore — except for René.

René decided to do a ritual — to change his life for the better and get the hell out of that stinking village.
He knew the dark ritual, like many other things, but he was afraid to bring a human corpse there.
He’d learned all that from his dead grandma — a witch who deeply loved her grandson and told him lots of scary, interesting stuff about black magic.

René planned everything.
He even drank some wine for courage.
Then, luring a neighbor’s child to his house and killing him, he rushed to the cemetery before anyone noticed the boy was gone.

Some joker had nailed up a wooden sign saying “Cemetery of Domestic Geese” right at the site.
René was shaking from fear and horror at what he’d done — but when he threw the corpse over the low stone fence, it vanished, like something had swallowed it whole.

Right after that, René felt a shift inside.
His body got light, his mind went calm — like it was meant to be.

Later, the gendarmerie and villagers searched for days…
but never found the boy.

René left to study in Bordeaux — and never came back to the village.

Ten years later, detectives finally caught a serial killer — a man who raped and murdered women and children.
His name was René.
He came from a remote French village.
More than a hundred victims were tied to him.
Before the execution, he mysteriously died in his solitary cell.
