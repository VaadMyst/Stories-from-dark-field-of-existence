GIFT

 
 

Nancy had already a year, as stopped loving her husband Tomas. She quietly hated

him and was afraid to say it, though he was a man with kind heart and never to hurt

her.

— We just have big difference in temperament,

she said it herself, also she thought

about divorce, but she was a such coward and depended

from others people opinions. In her opinion — her husband

had a stupid hobby — collecting figures of monsters and superheroes.

And she came up with a way to kill him quietly.

She bought a vintage figure and went to her village to old

witcher. He accepted her, maked his job and gave her

algorithm of action…

Nancy went home with smile, looking dreamy in the bus

window. On next day overcoming disgusting she gave to

Tomas a gift. He was rapture with a vintage figure of Superman.

He talked about it all day. And next morning he died.

After autopsy pathologist discovered the cause — heart failure.

— Insurance will cover all expenses and will some left over,

thought cheerful Nancy when she go to bed.

She didn’t know that her life also was included in payment.
