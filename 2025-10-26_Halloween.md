# 🎃 Halloween



📍Ireland. Present day.
The town of Kiltem.
Halloween Eve.


There was a knock at the door, and children’s voices sang:
“Trick or treat!”

The homeowner, smiling, opened the door with a bowl of sweets — and saw a boy in a cowboy hat and a girl in pyjamas.
He opened his mouth to say something — but a shotgun blast roared.
Point blank.

His stomach exploded, blood splattering the walls, and he flew backwards into the house like a rag doll, his legs comically up in the air.

“We don’t need any sweets — we’re here for the tricks!”
the children shouted, tossing the gun aside and laughing as they ran up the street.

Above the river, colourful fireworks bloomed beautifully in the sky, calling all the merry‑makers to celebrate…



In the town park, children were selling “homemade lemonade” for adults.
Mixing ice and shards of glass in a blender, they served it to passing visitors, then hid in the bushes — gleefully watching as those who drank began to double over in confusion and agony, clutching their stomachs, groaning and vomiting blood.

“Drink the free lemonade?
Straight to hell you’ll be made!”
they chanted from the bushes in a sing‑song rhyme.

The sound of ambulances echoed more and more often through the town, and soon no one could reach 911 —
the line was permanently busy.

And Halloween had only just begun.



Across town, at the local club where pumpkins, dolls and garlands decorated a children’s party, a clown in a circus costume stepped onto the stage.
The children clapped, and the adults smiled.

He pulled out a knife, giggled — and with one quick slash, cut his own cheeks open to his ears.
Blood gushed down his chin.

“That’s so I can smile even wider,”
he slurred through the mutilated grin, spitting red.

“And would you like another surprise?
Here’s my confetti!”

He plunged the knife into his stomach and ripped it upwards — his intestines spilled out onto the floor like streamers, filling the hall with the stench of blood and viscera.
The clown collapsed, drenching the front rows of children in blood.

Adults screamed and fainted,
while the laughing children grabbed the intestines and stretched them around the hall like garlands,
until the floor became slick with blood.

“The old clown’s had his final show,
On Samhain’s night he fell below!”
they sang in unison, over the shouts and cries:

“What the hell is going on here?!”



In an old garage, two boys and a girl were torturing a lonely old man fixing his rusted pickup truck.
They struck him with a shovel — he fell, unconscious.

They tied him up with rope, shoved a vacuum hose into his mouth and attached the other end to the exhaust pipe.

With an approving whistle, one of the boys started the engine.
The old man twitched, gasped; his face turned blue, eyes bulging from their sockets.
The children watched as he suffocated — clapping and singing:

“Smoked grandpa’s dead, Samhain’s dinner’s fed!”



In the centre of Kiltem, at the theatre where parents had gathered for a children’s play, a large group of masked kids blocked all the exits.

“Masks come off — and everyone dies!”
they sang together.

Homemade torches flared, setting the theatre alight from all sides.
The flames licked the walls greedily — and soon the whole building was burning.

Outside, the children clapped and laughed,
their faces glowing in the firelight,
while inside, the trapped adults screamed as the fire devoured them alive.

People on the street could do nothing — the flames were too fierce.
All they could do was listen to the shrieks and wails…
until the very last scream was silenced by the blaze.

The smell of burned flesh mixed with the smoke of fireworks, spreading through the town —
creeping into every dark corner,
as if searching for the spirits who had missed such a feast.



“What the hell is happening? The town’s gone mad — it’s burning, everything’s chaos!”
a shaken fireman shouted, spraying water on the blazing theatre where more than a hundred adults had burned alive.

“That’s because the spirits of Samhain got tired of eating sweets…”
said a little girl standing behind him —
and in her black eyes, wild flames were dancing.
