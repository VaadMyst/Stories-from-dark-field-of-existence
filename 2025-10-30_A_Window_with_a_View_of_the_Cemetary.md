# A Window with a View of the Cemetery



Spain. Present day.

Blanca arrived in the city from a small town to study at the Academy of Fine Arts, having easily passed all the admission requirements.
From early childhood, her parents noticed their daughter’s talent for drawing and encouraged her passion in every way. For as long as she could remember, every morning began with quick sketches or a caricature of her parents. And regardless of their mood or the weather, they always laughed.


Blanca smiled warmly, placing a family photo on the small table in her rented room in the old residential building.
The windows overlooked an old picturesque cemetery, where along a shady avenue stood monuments, darkened crypts, and gravestones — a memory of those who had long departed and rested in the world of shadows.

For a moment, Blanca thought about how she would cope with the death of her parents — and her heart ached with sadness.
Shaking off the grim thoughts, she picked up her sketchbook and began to draw.

⸻

Days passed in study one after another, and the leaves, scorched by the flame of autumn, fell with a deathly whisper, when Blanca first saw a funeral procession through one of the windows.
Her attention was drawn to how the funeral looked — she had only seen something similar in drawings of historical fashion and in paintings by 18th-century masters.
Everyone was dressed in black, and horses slowly pulled a platform with a coffin richly and tastefully decorated with flowers and ribbons.

“They must be shooting a period film,” Blanca thought.

But then she noticed: the view from the window was subtly hazy, as if several shades paler than the colors of the landscape outside.
She looked out the window — but the color didn’t change.

Her attention was diverted by something else: a woman in black, walking next to the coffin, stopped, then sharply turned and looked in Blanca’s direction.

Blanca flinched and recoiled from the window.

And then she saw the difference: in the other window, the colors were normal, natural… and the avenue was empty.

Frowning, she stepped back towards that very window with the procession. But now, there was no one in the cemetery.

“I didn’t imagine it. I definitely saw it,” Blanca muttered aloud and regretted not taking a photo with her phone.

Picking up her sketchbook, she began to make sketches of the strange woman — and soon, the black silhouette in a semi-turn gleamed dully on the paper.

⸻

Over the weekend, Blanca woke up quite late, ruffled, and yawned as she opened the window — and saw an unusual sight:
In the distance, many emaciated and unfashionably dressed people were digging a large pit among the graves. Armed men in red berets, blue shirts, and tall boots stood over them. They smoked, shouted maliciously, and, laughing gleefully, spat right on those who were working below.

“Is this a movie?” Blanca wondered, but no cameras or crew were visible anywhere.
Strange… everything looked as if it were happening for real.

Blanca rejected all violence, was a committed vegetarian, like her parents, who had instilled in her a humane attitude toward the world.

A covered, old truck arrived a little later — with equally exhausted people. With curses and a hail of blows, the soldiers herded them into the pit.

A shout rang out:
— ¡Arriba España!
And the soldiers opened fire, shooting the unarmed people at point-blank range.

Blanca shrieked piercingly at the horror she saw, and several soldiers, bolting from their positions, ran towards her.
She slammed the window shut with a bang and, trembling feverishly from shock, retreated into the room.

She urgently needed to find the reason for what was happening, because her entire inner world was cracking under the sheer terror of the sight.

“The phone,” Blanca remembered.

And then, the face of one of the soldiers appeared behind the glass, which was blurry from dust.

The face pressed against the window.
Blanca turned into a statue. The soldier’s face was silently grimacing, and his unfocused, possessed gaze wandered around the room, completely ignoring the girl.

This continued for some time.

“He can’t see me,” Blanca realized.

And then her gaze fell on the neighboring window — there was also an autumn haze there, but not so murky.

A moment later, the face disappeared.

Blanca collapsed onto the floor and couldn’t recover from what she had seen for a long time.

Later, having somewhat recovered, she grabbed her sketchbook and began to draw…

When Blanca showed her drawings at the academy, the teacher sighed heavily, praised her skill, and asked:
“Why did you choose such a theme for your work? This is the terrible past of Spain, which can never be washed away…”

Blanca hesitated and lied, saying she was deeply affected by the cruelty of what Franco’s Falangists had done in the recent past.

⸻

The next time Blanca saw a funeral procession in the window, it looked modern.
A black hearse drove slowly forward, and behind it, mourners shuffled along unhurriedly — all in black.
The orchestra played Chopin’s funeral march… the music of the last walk.

“Finally…” Blanca thought and took out her phone.

She aimed the camera — but the screen showed the usual landscape, without the procession.

The music stopped playing, and the entire procession suddenly halted and turned in her direction.

“Damn…” Blanca quickly crouched down and covered the window with a hand trembling from fright.
Later, when her heart stopped racing, she sat beneath the window and began to draw, pondering what had happened.

Do not engage, Blanca understood, they sense attention.
I must just observe — coldly and impartially.

This is the key to drawing them without being noticed.
It’s like a mirage, but a mirage capable of interacting with the world of the living.

“What if someone who lived here before me was so curious that… they were carelessly noticed?…”
And what then?
Were they eaten? Did they have their soul taken? Were they buried alive?…

Such thoughts spun in Blanca’s head.

But it turned out not — the landlady said that a certain elderly señor had lived there for a very long time, and then he suddenly packed his things and moved out.

Later, Blanca made inquiries. It turned out that the cemetery had been closed since the early ‘90s.
Following investigations into crimes from the Franco era, mass graves of the regime’s victims had been discovered there.
There were also burials from the time of the cholera epidemic within the cemetery’s grounds.

She remembered sketching horse-drawn carts piled high with bodies — looking like dirty sacks.
Silhouettes of orderlies with grappling hooks, dressed in strange uniforms, loomed nearby…

“Blanca, you’ve chosen an unusual and sad theme for your artwork, but you’re doing an excellent job,” the teacher praised her.

The end of the first academic year was approaching when Blanca noticed something amiss:
She began to wake up in the middle of the night from a strange and elusive noise and soon discovered the cause — someone or something was knocking on the window from outside, as if blindly searching for an entrance in the dark.

So, they sensed her, despite all precautions…
Maybe they sensed her like a flow of heat in a cold room? — the thought flashed through the frightened girl’s mind.

“It’s a good thing I keep the window closed,” Blanca thought.

After the incident with the soldier, she hadn’t opened it once… and certainly hadn’t dared to look out.

In the morning, with a fresh mind, she tried to connect the events.

“Could it be that all those drawings in the box are giving them life, fueling them — and now they are looking for the source? That is… me?” Blanca thought.

Later, having made a final decision, she gathered all the drawings and took them to the academy archive.
She intuitively felt that she needed to stop this — and quickly.

She told the landlady that she wouldn’t be renting the room for the next academic year, as she had found more modern accommodation, and with a peaceful heart, she left for her parents, taking with her the experience of something that science could not explain.

When the new tenant moved into the room — where one window was like a screen for a projector, on which Death showed stories from the dark past — a fresh renovation awaited him.
