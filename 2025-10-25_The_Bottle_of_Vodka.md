🖋 Preface
This story contains no fiction — only a composite truth about a time when life was worth less than a bottle.
This is not a tale about murder so much as about how everything human dies inside a person.



Russia, the ’90s


Ivan walked home from the factory exhausted and sullen — his shop foreman had humiliated him in front of everyone, calling him clumsy and a screw‑up for the rejected parts. They docked his pay and took compensation for the defective pieces out of his wages. A fitter’s wage was already paltry, and now, with the country convulsing after the coup, he was on the edge of destitution. At home, his wife was seven months pregnant… Thank God his parents helped; together they scraped by somehow.

With these thoughts, Ivan trudged along a filthy street where fallen leaves, cardboard, and god‑knows‑what were rotting — looked like the street cleaner had taken unpaid leave, he thought, approaching a piss‑soaked and vomit‑splattered kiosk. Behind it, happily snoring in a puddle of his own urine, was some bum. Ivan spat distastefully in his direction, stepped up to the window, and knocked. The smell from the drunk’s spot was unbearable.

“Bottle of vodka,” Ivan said, handing over the money.
“Just not some poison, okay?”
“Here,” a hand stuck out from a small barred window. “Bums have been drinking this vodka for days — no one’s died yet. All alive and well,” the seller laughed.
“Thanks,” Ivan grunted, shoving the cold bottle into his jacket pocket, and made his way through the lamplit park toward home, where the cries of a lost generation rose in the dusk.

He sat down on the first intact bench, took the bottle out, sighed, popped the cap in one motion, and took a long pull. He immediately grimaced — there was some bitter slime — yet the burning wave inside swept away all negative feelings.

“Good…” Ivan thought, but instantly it felt darker, even though the streetlight glared its usual blind yellow. In the screams from the gaping darkness of the park, it was clear someone was being mercilessly beaten. Ivan smiled: “Happens,” and took another swig without food, staring at his shoes.

His boots were covered either in autumn mud or maybe dog shit. It grew a little darker still.

“Bitch, fuck,” Ivan thought with irritation and hatred about his wife Svetlana. He didn’t notice how malicious thoughts took hold of his mind. He clenched his fists until they hurt, writhing with rage, and quietly howled from helplessness.

“How do you provide for a family in this fucking time? And why the hell did I go along with it: ‘Let’s have a child, our parents will give us an apartment, somehow we’ll survive, everything will be fine,’” she’d said. “Bitch! Scum!” His teeth ground with rabid hatred. Ivan drank through tears and took another gulp. The darkness crept closer, and it got even darker.

He came to himself some time later and looked at his watch (a gift from his wife) — it was almost midnight. He had sat on that bench for nearly five hours without noticing time pass. He pushed the half‑empty bottle back into his pocket and, swaying, went toward the grey, faceless apartment block whose dark stairwell yawned like an abandoned tomb reeking of urine and despair.

The teenage thugs on the bench quieted as he shuffled by — they seemed to sense: leave him, let him go.

He walked up to the fifth floor on foot (the lift didn’t work) and kicked his apartment door.
“Who’s there?” his wife’s frightened voice called.
“Open up, you bitch!” Ivan snarled. “Open up!”
He pounded the door again. After a tense pause, it opened.

Ivan barged into the flat, roughly shoving Svetlana aside. She grabbed her belly in fear and clapped a trembling hand to her mouth.
“Vanya, you promised you would stop drinking…”
“Shut your trap!” Ivan spat, without taking off his coat, and stumbled into the kitchen. He sat at the table and set the bottle — with only a couple of sips left — in front of him.

He was breathing heavily, as if it were hard for him, and didn’t take his eyes off the bottle. Svetlana crept into the kitchen; she was so frightened she couldn’t speak and trembled quietly at the sight of her husband in that state.

Ivan twisted the cap and took a huge gulp without flinching. It grew darker, as if only darkness surrounded him and the only thing visible ahead was the window. He felt Svetlana’s gaze — mute reproach in her eyes. When she tried to say something, Ivan rose wordlessly from his chair and smashed a fist into her face with all his force so that it made a wet thud — breaking her nose and knocking out teeth.

Svetlana flew back into the wall, overturned the dishes, and collapsed unconscious to the floor.

Scarlet blood spread beneath her head from the maimed face and ran toward Ivan’s dirty boots. He sat back down at the table. The house was quiet; everyone else was asleep long ago. Water dripped monotonously from the tap, and to that sound, he sank deeper into the darkness of his thoughts.

Ivan thought he had lost everything because he hadn’t gone on rotation with his mates — it was his bitch of a wife who had talked him out of going. Now they had cash, drove cars, while he counted every kopeck and they joked: “How’s the plant? All good?”

“Scum,” Ivan howled from suffocating rage and helplessness, and, tossing his head back, finished the remains of the vodka. The little window of light disappeared completely.

His face twisted with hatred; if he’d seen himself in a mirror, he would have seen nothing human. Ivan sprang up like a madman, looked down at the lying Svetlana, and began to stomp on her bulging stomach with his dirty boots, spewing curses. It wasn’t enough; he started to stomp on her chest and head, without thinking about what he was doing, striking again and again relentlessly. Her ribs cracked dryly, and under the weight of the beatings, Svetlana died along with the baby, never regaining consciousness.

Ivan woke the next morning, dressed, lying alone in bed with a terrible headache and a prickling dryness in his throat. He saw the sheets were filthy, stained with blood. He looked at his hands — his knuckles were battered and scraped, covered in dried blood.

His wife was not beside him.

He lay there, staring at his hands in bewilderment, trying to remember what had happened, but he could not.
