LOST PATH(AN COSÁN CAILLTE)


 

There are places on Earth where one should not walk alone —

where strange events occur that defy explanation.


This happened in the 1980s.

Bran, an experienced hiker, received a letter with no

return address.

Inside the envelope was a small booklet inviting him to take a

route through a historic region.

He began to doubt, but curiosity won. He packed and left.

The name of the trail kept circling in his mind —

it felt oddly familiar.

Morning arrived, and Bran set off on the trail.

The path turned out to be eerie — thick with overgrown brush

and deadly cliffs.

He didn’t see how stones turned after him, how birds fell silent,

how the wind in the branches lost its strength.

Bran realized something was wrong when, at dusk, he saw a

familiar landmark —

yet the sky had been lead-gray all day,

his compass jammed, and his watch had stopped.He recalled the name of the trail — A Slí Caillte,

but he still couldn’t leave the path.

People have gone missing on this trail for as long

as anyone can remember.

And the few hikers who still walk it

sometimes see the ghost of a man with a backpack,

rushing along the path in a voiceless scream.

Legend says that after meeting him,

a person may forget the way back.
