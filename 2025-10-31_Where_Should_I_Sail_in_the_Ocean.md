# Where Should I Sail in the Ocean of Sorrow


Where should I sail in the Ocean of Sorrow?
I've lost count of the days.
No end, no shore is in sight—
I just keep gliding over the cold waves.

I am afraid to remain here forever,
But no prayer will be on my lips.
From helplessness, for the torn sail,
A scream grated between my teeth.

The dawn just won't come,
The Moon gives birth to a dead gloom.
Her radiance—of anguish and despair—
Touches the very bottom.

Time has blown out my lighthouses,
Like candles—they went out. Since it's so,
The keeper spat on fate
And left me here to die.

Where should I sail in the Ocean of Sorrow,
Where Sirens beg for water?...
My heart is deaf and mute to them.
If only I could just make it to spring...
