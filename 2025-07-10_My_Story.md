# My Story
 
 
One fine summer day, while I was spending time doing nothing, waiting for a response about my future
from some higher authorities, I was watching tourists.
They were flowing in a stream and looked like parrots, while the locals — like ruffled sparrows — called
out to each other in greetings.
The town was small: the locals knew each other, and tourists were probably a significant part of it.
While walking, I noticed a woman who stood out from the crowd.
She was well-dressed, and there was something unusual about her.
My “age-detector” instantly said — over fifty, but she looked younger.
Her behavior didn’t fit the usual program.
And I was even more surprised when I heard what she was asking people.
She was offering 20 euros to anyone who could tell her an interesting story — real or fictional — that
she would enjoy.
But everyone just smiled and walked past.
Only one kid tried to say something, but his parents pulled him back, saying: “That lady’s not right in the
head.”
I stood at a distance and watched.
But it seemed she noticed me — a drifting idler — and with a sly smile, she came up and said:
— Can you tell me a story that will interest me?
And I said, without thinking:
— Yes.
— Excellent, — she said. — My name is Claire. That’s enough for now, — she added, smiling.
I introduced myself, we shook hands, and at that moment, I felt like we’d known each other forever.
— Well then, — Claire said, — let’s go to a café. I think you’ll tell me a story. And if I don’t like it — it’ll at
least be worth a cup of coffee.
I liked her approach.
We went to a café like old friends, glancing at each other and at the people rushing down the street.
We entered the café Claire had picked, sat down, and ordered coffee.
I told her:
— If you’re looking for a writer or just amusing yourself, I might surprise you a bit. From time to time,
yes, I write small stories. Here’s one of them…
I told her the story about "Phó", the Vietnamese soup.
When I finished, she looked at me for a long time.
Then she placed 20 euros on the table and said:
— More.
Without blinking, I told her the story about "The Iron".
She took out her wallet and placed 50 euros on the table.— Tell me more, — she said.
Then I told her “The Jockey on a Dead Horse.”
She laid down 100 euros.
Then — about "The Telephone, The Café “Adieu”…
At some point she stopped me and said:
— Enough. I’ve run out of cash for your stories, — she laughed.
— But not out of interest or curiosity for what you’ll write next.
She pulled out a business card, placed it on the table, and said:
— I’m waiting for you at this address. Come when you’re ready.
She said goodbye and left.
I picked up the card.
It had the name of a publishing house.
And under the director’s name, it said: Claire.
