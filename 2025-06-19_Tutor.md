# Tutor



Florida, USA, 1980s

No one even remembered where that elderly woman had come from,
or why she had a pig instead of a dog.

“She’s very strange,” said the neighbors,
curiously glancing at her cozy little house.
All they knew was that she used to be a math teacher in her youth.

This pleasant-looking woman could explain the world through numbers,
but she couldn’t explain her own nature through human logic.
She only survived by attaching herself to the human field —
she “drank” youth and vitality to keep herself in shape.

Her servant was a low-level entity in the form of a pig.
No one could stay with her for long,
because they would irreversibly lose their life energy.

She wasn’t evil — she simply was the way she was.
That was her nature — she simply needed life force.

And one day, events began to accelerate…

Communicating mentally with the entity in the pig’s body,
the woman suddenly felt very unwell —
a graveyard-like cold began to bind her heart.
She wheezed horribly.

The entity in the form of the pig quickly made the right decision
and ran out into the street to get attention.
It knew that if its mistress died, it would be devoured.

It ran out into the road in front of a car.
The car stopped sharply, and a surprised man looked out.
He saw the pig screaming and looking at the house.

Intrigued, he followed the pig into the house,
and seeing the danger, called an ambulance.

“You have very low blood pressure,”
said the paramedic after examining the woman
and not noticing anything suspicious.

“It’s time to start tutoring,” the woman thought,
smiling to herself.
