# The Umbrella



Ahrweiler, West Germany, 2021
Based on real events

Hans moved out of his parents’ house into the old home of his grandparents. They had recently been taken to a care home, as they required constant supervision.
They were already so ancient that it seemed they remembered Bismarck’s coronation.

The house stood in the centre of the city, and that was a real stroke of luck: Hans was studying, writing his thesis, and now he could live alone — in silence, surrounded by numerous old things and yellowed books steeped in the past.

He mentally thanked his parents and grandparents: to have an entire house, even a dilapidated one, was more than winning the lottery.
Hans wandered through the house — through rooms cooled by the absence of human presence — examining objects from the past inherited from his ancestors.
The items, covered in dust, seemed so fragile — as if time had dried them out to the state of old parchment.

Hans chose the spacious bedroom of his grandparents to live in for the time being, until he could sort through all the belongings.
He felt sorry to part with them so easily, as they were all part of his family’s past.
Smiling, Hans opened the dimmed windows, and bright sunlight along with the hot summer wind burst into the room, scattering the dust and gloom of the past.

Hans was making space in the wardrobe, packing old items into cardboard boxes, when on the bottom shelf he discovered a long bundle, tightly wrapped in plastic film.

— A rifle, — Hans immediately thought, taking the heavy bundle into his hands.

He set the items aside and, intrigued, began to unwrap the find.

When he reached the contents, to Hans’s surprise, it was a large umbrella made of black silk, soaked in something oily and with a strange, specific smell.
The handle was made of white ivory, and the sharp tip gleamed menacingly with steel.

Hans stared at the find, mesmerised: it felt more like a weapon than a protection against bad weather.

Hans tried to open it, and with some effort, the umbrella creaked and rustled as the heavy fabric spread wide.

— Wow, it’s huge! — Hans exclaimed with admiration and turned at a noise from the window.

Outside, it had started to rain, even though there wasn’t a single cloud in the sky.

Paying it no mind, he closed the umbrella, satisfied that it was intact and fully functional.
The rain stopped instantly.

— Well then, — Hans said with a doubtful smile, and set the umbrella aside for later.
He already had an idea how he might use it in the future.

The heat wouldn’t let up, and for the weekend Hans arranged with his girlfriend Luisa to go to the river.
On Saturday morning, when Hans had already packed all the things and was ready to leave, Luisa called and said she wouldn’t go, citing feeling unwell.

— Scheiße, — Hans said with frustration as the dial tone echoed in the receiver.

— I’m already packed, my horse is hitched, just need to ride! — he sang jokingly, started the car and drove to the river.

When the heat at the river became unbearable, Hans took out the umbrella and, smiling in anticipation of some shade, opened it.

Instantly, rain began to fall.

Hans looked up: no clouds, sun shining, and rain falling.

— This is some prank, — he thought, but the rain continued.
In the distance, people were staring at the sky in confusion, not understanding what was going on.

Hans slowly closed the umbrella.
The rain stopped.

Sitting down on the damp sand, he began opening and closing the umbrella.
With each creak of the mechanism, the rain would start and stop.

Hans began to laugh at the realisation of what he had found, and felt like the happiest man alive — a wizard being served by the elements.

While the rain poured, he examined the umbrella from the inside and found nothing unusual — just a small triangle engraved on the handle.

Soon, having devoted all his time to the discovery, Hans continued experimenting.
He opened the umbrella for different durations and discovered that light rain never lasted long:
	•	After 10 minutes, it always turned into a downpour and storm clouds would gather.
	•	30 minutes or more — thunderstorm.

The rain wouldn’t stop immediately after closing the umbrella and continued for a while afterwards.
The longer the umbrella remained open, the longer the rain’s inertia would last.

— Unglaublich! — he whispered, feeling how the power over the elements was filling him.

He had already begun to consider the responsibility placed on his shoulders and understood perfectly well what his carelessness might lead to.

Soon, his excellent mood — as well as his noble plans to take the umbrella to Namibia — were ruined by a letter from the local tax office.

— Erbschaftsteuer… Bloody inheritance tax, how could I forget! — Hans whispered in despair, running his hands through his hair.

After counting all his savings, he realised he couldn’t manage it on his own.
He called his parents.

— Hans, — they said, — you’re an adult now. Deal with your problems yourself. We warned you.

Hans was in despair. He paced the room, unable to find peace.
He boiled with anger at the tax office, at the whole stupid system, and at those who had come up with it all.

And then, in his line of sight, appeared the umbrella.

— Yes! — Hans grinned wickedly, instantly devising his revenge on the city.

Standing by the window, watching the people bustling below, he felt like a master of fates — in his hands was something that couldn’t be measured in financial terms.

Without hesitation, Hans opened the horribly creaking umbrella with effort — as if it was resisting being part of such a dishonourable act — and the rain instantly began drumming on the windowsill.

Casually tossing it into the corner of the attic room,
Hans-the-Wizard, as he jokingly called himself, leaned back contentedly in his chair and began pondering how the city services would deal with such a deluge and what losses the treasury would incur.

Two hours later, with a pounding heart, Hans, smiling, looked out through the slightly opened window at a rainstorm of unprecedented power, staring with satisfaction at the punished city.

— This calls for a celebration, — he said, rubbing his hands. — Coffee with cognac will do nicely.

And he rushed down the stairs to the kitchen.

Hurriedly descending, Hans slipped on the stairs — due to the rainwater that had seeped through holes in the roof.
And before he could grab the handrail, he fell, tumbling down the stairs, breaking his neck.

There was no one left who could close the umbrella in the attic.

His glassy eyes no longer saw how the unleashed magic of the elements broke bridges, flooded streets, flipped over cars, and, undercutting, brought down houses, taking the lives of innocent people.

It all ended only when the water undercut Hans’s house to the point it collapsed into the raging current, burying the miracle — which had never found a worthy keeper.
