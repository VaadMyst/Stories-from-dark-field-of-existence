# Under the Bed



Ottawa, Canada. 1980s.

“There’s nothing there,” her parents snapped again — tired of her tantrums.
“But how can that be?” Diana thought. “They are there… under the bed, in the closet, in the flicker of light, when you look at yourself in the mirror…”

Diana felt, instead of her parents’ love — only dull irritation and regret.
She heard everything: their voices rising in another late‑night argument in the kitchen. She was afraid to be alone in that house of shouting, where love no longer held anything together.

And when feelings like fear, guilt, and rejection have nowhere to go, they become like an open wound — through which something else seeps in.
It crawls in, growing stronger, ready to drag you where no imagination reaches, where no one will hear you, or find you, or save you — while they drink your soul alive.

Diana trembled under the blanket — it had become her only shield, the last thing that still gave her a sense of safety, separating her from the awful, engulfing fear that came from the one with no name.

She clamped her hands over her mouth and whimpered in terror.
Something was scratching under the bed.
Footsteps — across the empty room, where no one should be.

“Just fall asleep… just fall asleep and run away…” Diana whispered.
But her little body shook, and the bed was wet with fear.

And then she understood: that’s why older kids wet the bed — not because they’re small, but because if you leave the blanket, it’s waiting — the one with no name.

When her parents rushed in at their daughter’s muffled scream, there was no one in the room.
The wardrobe was empty.
Nothing under the bed.
And the only window was sealed for winter.

If they had known how, they might have seen what had stolen — and devoured — their daughter.
You only needed to place a mirror at just the right angle… and look into it.
And then they would have understood: after what they’d see, you must never turn off the light — and above all, never sleep in the dark.
