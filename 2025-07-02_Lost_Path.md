# LOST PATH (An Cosán Caillte)



There are places on Earth where one should not walk alone —
places where strange events occur that defy explanation.

This happened in the 1980s.
Bran, an experienced hiker, received a letter with no return address.

Inside the envelope was a small booklet, inviting him to take a route
through a historic region.

He hesitated, but curiosity won. He packed and left.
The name of the trail kept circling in his mind —
it felt oddly familiar.

Morning arrived, and Bran set off.

The path turned out to be eerie —
thick with overgrown brush and deadly cliffs.

He didn’t notice how stones shifted behind him,
how the birds fell silent,
how the wind in the branches lost its breath.

Bran realized something was wrong when, at dusk,
he saw a familiar landmark —
yet the sky had been lead-gray all day,
his compass jammed, and his watch had stopped.

He recalled the name of the trail: A Slí Caillte.
But he still couldn’t leave the path.

People have gone missing on this trail
for as long as anyone can remember.

And the few hikers who still dare to walk it
sometimes see the ghost of a man with a backpack,
rushing along the path in a voiceless scream.

Legend says:
after meeting him, you may forget the way back.
