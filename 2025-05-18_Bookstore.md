 # Bookstore



Laima came earlier than the bookstore opened
to buy a bestseller by her favorite writer.
She waited for the store to open and, when
she entered, she saw a queue near
the cash register.

She thought:
“Hmm… strange. I was first to enter.”

Laima went to the shelves with bestsellers,
but instead of them, there were strange books —
all with titles like dreams no one had ever seen.

She took one of them and opened it.

Inside were words that didn’t exist,
and pictures that had never been painted.
They were created in unborn imagination,
in a reality alien to the human mind.

She didn’t buy a book.

After a moment, Laima no longer understood
where she was.

She had entered a place
where there were no answers.
Only a queue of questions:

Who am I?
Where am I?
Why am I here?

Nobody knows where that bookstore is now.
And whether it exists in our reality.
