I know you’re there, Vlad.  
Tired.  
Sitting on the floor, your back against the door.  

You’ve always listened to me.  
And you know perfectly well — nothing will ever be alright.  
You know it as well as I do.  

You’ve held the doorknob so many times, afraid to let me in.  
But all it takes is one small pull — and you’ll fall into the abyss.  
It will swallow you whole, along with all your sorrows.  

But it’s not for me to decide.  
If you wish — open it yourself,  
and I’ll help you dissolve into oblivion.  

Without pain.  
Without the fear you live with now.  

There will be no more morning light that makes you sick,  
and despair will never touch your heart again.  

You live in constant stress,  
in quiet panic,  
in the awareness of the utter futility of your miserable existence…  

You’ve gone over countless plans for ending it.  
By now, you don’t even need me —  
you already know what to do with this “life”,  
as those more adjusted ones call it —  
weighed down by chains like family, debt, mortgage…  

You have none of that.  
You call yourself a failure.  
You’re ashamed before your parents,  
and that guilt makes you grind your teeth until they ache.  

You pray to yourself at night —  
that you won’t wake up.  

You — a stray shadow — wander through the city at night  
and realise: there’s no place here for dying.  
Because you don’t want to inconvenience anyone, do you?  
Even before the final step, you think:  
*“What will people say?”*  

You can’t laugh sincerely, Vlad.  
Or feel joy.  
Or feel happy.  

Your kindness, your self‑doubt, your uncertainty —  
all stop you from throwing off all this filth  
and making the final choice.  

Stop being a coward.  
Look at yourself in the mirror.  
What do you see?  
What?!!!  

Stop lying to yourself.  

I know — you’re so very tired.  
You can’t take it anymore.  
You feel wrong in your own body,  
in this reality.  

You’ve already written your suicide note —  
and you know what?  
I’m impressed.  
I liked it.  

And now, Vlad… turn around.  
Look.  
See?  
I’ve opened the door a little.  

If I wanted to — I could drag you in,  
like a childhood monster from the dark.  

Now you stare into that blackness beyond the door  
and think:  
*“What didn’t I manage to do in this miserable life?  
And does it even matter anymore?”*  

You’ve always been able to open the door yourself.  
You always could.  

**The choice is yours.**

Suicide Note

Forgive me.  
I failed you.  
Everything I did was in vain.  

I never thought life could be so empty and meaningless.  

I have nothing left to live for,  
nothing left to wait for.  

It’s far too late to change anything.  
Oh, Heaven — too late.  

Life has become torture for me,  
a curse with the foul breath of a crone.  

All this time, I only pretended to live.  
I made my decision long ago,  
and laughed with everyone to drown the pain —  
knowing that afterward,  
your life would go on without me.  

And everything…  
everything I did and lived through  
was in vain.  

Did I ever think I’d end up writing this… my own suicide note?

Please, forgive me.  


**Vladislav**
