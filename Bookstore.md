Bookstore

 

 

Laima came earlier than the bookstore opened

to buy a bestseller by favorite writer.

She waited for the store to open and when

she entered, she saw a queue near

a cash register.

She thought: Hmm… strange. I was first to enter.

Laima went to shelves with bestsellers, but instead of them,

there were strange books —

all with titles like dreams no one had ever seen.

She has taken one of them and opened it.

Inside were words that didn’t exist, and pictures that had

never been painted.

They were created in unborn imagination,

in a reality alien to the human mind.

She didn’t buy a book.

After moment Laima no longer understood

where is she.

She had entered a place,

where no answers. But there

were only a queue from questions:Who am I?

Where am I?

And why am I here?

Nobody knows where that bookstore is now.

And does it exist in our reality?
