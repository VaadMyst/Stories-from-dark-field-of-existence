Jockey on a Dead Horse

 

(Aintree Racecourse, 1950s)

Aintree â€” a suburb of Liverpool, England. The 1950s.

Sasha, a miniature jockey who looked like a child, was resting

in a guest house before the race, near the barn with elite

racehorses, when the guard started banging and shouting:

â€” Sasha, run quick! Your Dead Horse was poisoned!

She jumped off the bed with her heart pounding wildly and ran

toward the barn in her pajamas, pushing the guard aside.

â€” I called the manager, heâ€™s on his way, â€” the guard shouted

after her, but Sasha wasnâ€™t listening.

This horse had been with her too long for it all to end like this.

Crying, she burst into the barn.

The horses were trembling and snorting, their ears moving like

radars to every sound, and Sasha understood by their reaction:

they were terrified.

She entered the stall and saw her favorite â€” already stiff, foam

at the mouth speaking of horrific pain before death.

She cried quietly, looking at the corpse; her tears flowing like

two mountain rivers.â€” The barn door was locked, Sasha, â€” said the guard who

came up. â€” Not even a fly couldâ€™ve gotten past meâ€¦

â€” Leave us alone and shut the door, â€” said the manager,

quietly stepping in â€” in a gray tweed jacket, hat, and with a

briefcase.

He stared at the horse in silence.

â€” Heâ€™s like a racetrack mage, â€” Sasha thought through her

sobs. He was quiet, more than restrained, always calm,

speaking softly.

She felt his intuition worked flawlessly, as if he could read

space itself and knew which foot she woke up on.

â€” Aintree, â€” he said. â€” Did you ever wonder, Sasha, why

this place is called Aintree? Why the racetrack was built here?

You donâ€™t knowâ€¦

A long time ago, on the spot of this racetrack, I planted a tree

â€” a horse chestnut â€” on the grave of my beloved horse.

She was everything to meâ€¦ Yes, Sasha, a friend and ally, and I

was ready to do anything to bring her back.

And I found itâ€¦ or it found me.

That night, I had a dream â€” a voice told me what to do.Iâ€™ll skip the details, Sasha, but after resurrecting the horse,

years later, I couldnâ€™t keep the tree.

It gave her life, and now I have to extend it by other means â€”

the ones youâ€™re about to see.

The manager paused. Sasha waited.

â€” I need your consent. And silence after what youâ€™ll see. It

may be beyond your understanding.

â€” Well, do you agree?

Sasha nodded uncertainly. The manager looked at her long,

and she felt darkness swirling in his eyes.

Then he pulled out a medical kit from the briefcase and said:

â€” I need to draw a full glass of your blood.

Sasha, hypnotized by her own consent, silently extended her

arm.

The manager drew her blood into a strange metal container,

then poured it into the horseâ€™s open mouth.

â€” Now letâ€™s go, â€” he said.

â€” By tomorrow morning, everything will be fine.

â€” Sleep well, Sasha, â€” he said goodbye.ðŸŒ„ At dawn, Sasha couldnâ€™t remember right away what

happened the night before.

What was that? What the hell?

But the morning was so clear and sunny that the darkness of

the ritual, death, and the managerâ€™s promise all felt like a

dream.

Yet the prick on her arm still ached.

She took out the envelope with amphetamine and dosed

herself.

Sasha had used it for a long time â€” she tended to gain weight

and kept her shape in this not-so-healthy way.

Trembling with adrenaline, she held her breath and walked into

the barn.

She approached the stall slowly.

The horse was alive and well. It snorted softly in greeting,

stretched out its neck, and the warm, soft lips touched Sashaâ€™s

hand.

The anxiety faded, along with any doubt. She accepted it all

and understood: it was real.

Later, together with the stablehand, they prepared the horse for

the race. Everything was ready.Dead Horse broke ahead at the starting line to wild whistles

and roars of the crowd.

She clearly wasnâ€™t the favorite, and no one expected such

energy from this mare.

Sasha merged with her breathing and the rhythmic pounding of

her hooves, ignoring everything else.

The horse raced as if she was the one who took the

amphetamine â€” not Sasha â€” and kept leading the race like a

mythical Pegasus, not a resurrected Dead Horse.

On the second lap, as if catching a signal from a warped

dimension, Sasha began to weaken rapidly, feeling worse the

closer she got to the finish line.

As if all her life force was pouring out through the reins.

When Dead Horse crossed the finish line as the winner,

Sasha fell from the saddle. Dead.
