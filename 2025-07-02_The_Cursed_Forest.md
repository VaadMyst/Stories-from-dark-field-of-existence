# The Cursed Forest


Based on real events. Present day.

On the Balkan Peninsula, there is a creepy place — a place that remembers the burned scream.
Where once people were sacrificed, burned alive, and mass executions took place —
after which the brotherly graves stank, devouring themselves.
And then a forest grew there — against everything.
Ugly like a leper’s face, and terrifying in its silence.

Birds don’t sing here, and those that fly in — scream in pain and drop dead.
Even in our time, in that forest, sadists, killers, bandits, and other scum in human form
tortured, abused, and murdered people… just for fun.
And no one — absolutely no one — knew or even guessed why they were drawn to that place.

But one thing they knew for sure: after what they did, their lives started going great —
as if it were a blessing for the sacrifice from the cursed land where thousands of people died in agony.

Dry branches cracked underfoot like human bones
and grabbed at clothes like small children’s hands.

Bojan was a local and got lost in that ugly forest, knowing nothing about its past.
But he understood — he had been there too long, and he felt deep inside that something was wrong.

And suddenly he remembered everything he thought he had long forgotten:
when he was a sapper during the Balkan conflict, together with his comrades —
drunk and high on impunity —
they raided a small village and, just for fun, raped and murdered civilians.
All the remaining women and children — they burned alive in a barn as witnesses.

All his comrades soon died. Only he remained — a retired veteran,
who went through the whole war untouched. Until that day.

Late at night, the forest let him go, taking his soul and memories — for weakness.
As payment to pass.

On the weekend, prepared, Bojan invited his friends and acquaintances to a party.
And when they were all celebrating, he locked the house and burned himself along with the guests.
