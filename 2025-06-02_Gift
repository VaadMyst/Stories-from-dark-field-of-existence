# GIFT


Nancy had already stopped loving her husband Tomas a year ago.
She quietly hated him and was afraid to say it —
even though he was a kind-hearted man who never hurt her.

“We just have a big difference in temperament,”
she told herself.

She thought about divorce, but she was too much of a coward
and too dependent on other people’s opinions.

In her eyes, Tomas had a stupid hobby —
collecting figurines of monsters and superheroes.

And so, she came up with a quiet way to kill him.

She bought a vintage figure and went to her village,
to an old witcher.

He accepted her, did his job, and gave her an algorithm of action.

Nancy returned home smiling,
staring dreamily out of the bus window.

The next day, overcoming her disgust,
she handed Tomas the gift.

He was ecstatic about the vintage Superman figure.
He talked about it all day.

And the next morning, he died.

The autopsy revealed the cause — heart failure.

“Insurance will cover all expenses… maybe some will be left over,”
thought cheerful Nancy as she went to bed.

She didn’t know
that her life was also part of the payment.
