# THE PICNIC



It was a beautiful summer day.
A family went out for a picnic —
a mother, a father, and their two beloved children.

They drove to their favorite place by the river,
a quiet spot they all loved.

The parents started grilling meat —
they adored it,
and everyone always praised their cooking.

Meanwhile, their son and daughter were fishing by the water.

Suddenly, the boy caught something.
Excited, the cheerful girl ran back to tell the parents.

When the boy pulled it out —
it was a heavy boot.

Out of the boot spilled some small fish…
and inside — a half‑rotten human foot.

The children screamed in terror.

The mother quietly said to the father:
“How could you hide the evidence so badly?”
