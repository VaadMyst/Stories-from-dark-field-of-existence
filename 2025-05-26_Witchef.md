# Witchef


Let me tell you a story about a woman — a little fairy whispered it to me.

Somewhere, for someone, this woman is a teacher.
Somewhere else, she is a witchef — a magical cook.

She has a special gift: the ability to travel freely through the multiverses of cooking shows and multicultural gatherings.

She has seen many strange worlds —
Where cucumbers taste like caramel,
Raspberries smell like dill,
And chicken eggs sing in the fridge.

Her golden rule:
Never ask the soup questions, and never talk to the dishes.
(But sometimes, the hardest part of her double life is when ingredients act like living beings —
and pizza or pies on the table suddenly want to tell a joke.)

Still, a pinch of magic always solves the problem.
Her dishes are always top-tier — just like her tireless humor and optimism,
which lifts the spirits of everyone around her.

ABRACADABRA.
