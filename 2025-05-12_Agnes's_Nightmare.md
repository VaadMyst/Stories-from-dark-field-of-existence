# AGNES'S NIGHTMARE

Agnes was discharged from a hospital after an alcohol-induced coma.  
And after a week, her friends invited her to a party.  
While passing a boutique, she saw a luxurious dress with a tag: 50% OFF.  
She had lost a lot of weight after the coma,  
and the dress fit her very well — so she bought it.

When she got home, she started preparing for the party.  
She put on the dress, snorted a few lines before leaving, and the mirror smiled at her :)

When she arrived, friends welcomed her — and as she started dancing, she saw a girl in the same dress…  
The same dress was worn by her ex-girlfriend!  
Agnes hid her face in her palms…  
and then all the guests at the party started laughing.

From horror and shame, the ground under her legs gave way —  
and then she woke up again.

In reality — in a hospital bed, after an alcohol-induced coma.
